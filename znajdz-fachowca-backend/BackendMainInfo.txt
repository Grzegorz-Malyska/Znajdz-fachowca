Entities (all implement Serializable):
    Category:           categories are predefined
        name - UNIQUE
    Rate:
        rate - int
        description
        raterName
        dateOfAdd - LocalDate - mapping (?????)
    Expert:
        image - @Lob, String, base64
        categories - List<Category>
        rates - List<Rate>
        name - UNIQUE
        description
        address - street + houseNumber
        city
        postCode
        phoneNumber
        email
        isPrivatePerson

Currently defined operations on entities:
    Category:
        getAllCategoriesNames() : List<String>
    Rate:
        =
    Expert:
        getExpertsByCityAndCategoryName(city, categoryName) : List<Expert>
        addExpert(expert) : void; expert entity can be without proper mapping to categories and rates

HTTP operations on entities (ALL REQUESTS ARE CROSS ORIGINED and mapped to /api):
    Category:
        /categories GET - List<String> with categories' names
    Rate:
        ----
    Expert:
         /expert GET; query string: city=CITY_NAME, category=CATEGORY_NAME - List<Expert> by CITY_NAME and CATEGORY_NAME
         /expert POST; expert in request's body - adds expert

All RuntimeException based exceptions
    are automatically converted to 404 HTTP status code and exception's message is sent in body of response.
All correctly ended requests are responsed with 200 HTTP status code and properly body of response.

Global algorithm for handling AJAX responses:
    OK (200) -> make standard use of response's data
    ERROR (=/= 200, probably 404) -> display text (at for example dismissable alert) from response's body
